# Donkey Kong Python
This file will cover the game basics and developer basics. 

## Running the Game 
To launch the game run: 
```

```


## Developer Setup 
You will need [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) installed.

You will also need the `PyGame` module, that can be installed with this command once Python has been installed:
